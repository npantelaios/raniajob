We study how the intestine generates protective responses against invading pathogens (resistance) while absorbing beneficial microbe\u2013 and food\u2013derived molecules (tolerance). Several cellular and molecular mechanisms exist to ensure robust tolerance induction in the mucosal surfaces, and disruption of such processes often leads to severe chronic inflammatory pathologies such as colitis, Celiac disease and food allergies, and colorectal cancer. We seek to understand how immunity at the intestinal are generated and how they can contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis while protecting us from invading pathogens and cancer.Research Focus Areas\u2022Microbiota Immunity: Mechanisms that regulate immune tolerance and immune responses to commensal microorganisms in the intestine\u2022Food Antigen Immunity: Pathways underlying immune tolerance to dietary antigens while preserving host defense\u2022Cancer Immunity: Roles of intestinal immune cells in colorectal cancer development and progression, including anti\\- and pro\\-tumor immune programs Overview:\n\nWe are seeking a highly motivated post\\-baccalaureate Research Assistant to join our laboratory studying adaptive immune responses at the intestinal mucosa.\nResponsibilities:\n\nResponsibilities include:* Conduct laboratory experiments using mouse models and intestinal tissues to study adaptive immune responses in the gut, applying immunological and molecular techniques such as flow cytometry, RNA sequencing preparation, cell culture, bacterial culture, ELISA, immunoblotting, and PCR\\-based methods.\n* Maintain and manage mouse colonies, including animal handling, monitoring health and breeding, genotyping, recordkeeping, and ensuring compliance with institutional animal care and use protocols.\n* Collect, analyze, interpret, and document experimental data; prepare figures, summaries, and reports for lab meetings, presentations, and research discussions.\n* Maintain accurate, complete, and organized laboratory records and documentation in laboratory notebooks and electronic systems to ensure data integrity and reproducibility.\n* Prepare, aliquot, label, and maintain laboratory reagents and supplies; operate, clean, and perform routine maintenance on laboratory equipment and instruments.\n* Collaborate with researchers to design and execute experiments.\n* Stay up to date with relevant scientific literature.\n* Performs related duties and responsibilities as assigned or requested.\n\n\nQualifications:\n**REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:**  \n\n* Bachelor's degree in biology, or a related field.\n* Interest in immunology, mucosal biology, or cancer biology.\n* This position is intended for **post\\-baccalaureate candidates.**\n* Must have basic previous laboratory training in biological or biomedical research techniques.\n* Willingness and ability to work with laboratory animal and biological specimens.\n* Strong attention to detail and organizational skills.\n* Accurate recordkeeping ability.\n* Proficient in using laboratory equipment and instruments.\n* Excellent communication and teamwork skills.\n* Ability to follow protocols and standard operating procedures.\n* Ability to work independently and as part of a team.\n\n **PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:*** Prior hands\\-on experience working with animal models.\n* Experience with immunological techniques such as flow cytometry, ELISA, or immunoblotting.\n* Experience with molecular biology techniques, including PCR, RNA/DNA extraction, or cloning.\n* Familiarity with mammalian or bacterial cell culture, including anaerobic culture techniques.\n* Experience with data analysis.\n\n  \n\nThe Rockefeller University is an equal opportunity employer \u2013 veterans/individuals with disabilities.

Tagraxofusp is also being evaluated as both a single agent and in combination, in other CD123\\+ indications, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), and myelofibrosis (MF).  \n\nAdditionally, Menarini received exclusive rights to commercialise Selinexor for the treatment of oncology indications in the European Union and other European countries (including the United Kingdom), Latin America and other key countries. Menarini has signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Karyopharm Therapeutics for the rights to commercialise an innovative therapeutic option in Europe, Latin America, Turkey, Russia, and CIS countries. Selinexor is a first\\-in\\-class, oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear export compound for the treatment of hematologic cancers and solid tumours. It is already marketed in the US for multiple myeloma and is under development for solid tumour indications. Selinexor is registered in the EU for both early and late lines.  \n\nMenarini entered into a global licence agreement with Radius Health to complete the development of Elacestrant, an oral SERD in late\\-stage Phase 3 development for hormone receptor\\-positive advanced breast cancer. Following a successful phase 3 study, Menarini Stemline received FDA approval in January 2023 under priority review and successfully oversaw a strong launch in February to the US market with the EMA review process concluded positively in September 2023\\.  \n\nMenarini\u2019s commitment to oncology is also reflected in the investments made in the liquid biopsy diagnostic field through its affiliate Menarini Silicon Biosystems (MSB), a pioneer in rare cell analysis and non\\-invasive, advanced diagnostic solutions. MSB\u2019s CELLSEARCH Circulating Tumour Cell (CTC) Test is the first and only clinically validated blood test cleared by the U.S. Food \\& Drug Administration (FDA) for detecting and counting CTCs in metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer when used in conjunction with other clinical monitoring methods.  \n\nSince 2021, MSB has offered in the US a menu of non\\-invasive Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) provided through its CLIA/CAP accredited US\\-based Lab. The services include CMC enumeration, CTC enumeration and PDL\\-1/HER2 biomarker and offer a minimally invasive approach to follow cancer patient\u2019s therapeutic journey.  \n\nIn 2022, the company launched the CELLSEARCH\u00ae Circulating Multiple Myeloma Cell (CMMC) Enumeration LDT, the first\\-of\\-its\\-kind, which directly measures levels of plasma cells in the blood of patients. This test provides new, complementary information to that of the bone marrow biopsy and other standard\\-of\\-care measures. Due to its minimally invasive nature, it can be performed serially to assess plasma cell burden without requiring repeated bone marrow biopsies.  \n\nMenarini's vision and uniqueness in oncology is to bring together innovative therapeutic solutions and advanced liquid biopsy\\-based diagnostics for faster, more effective and precise patient management.  \n\nIt is an exciting time in the company\u2019s development and an excellent opportunity for individuals joining us to contribute to building and shaping Menarini Stemline\u2019s Oncology business.",
