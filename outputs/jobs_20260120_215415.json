    "description": "SHIFT:\n\n\nDay (United States of America)**Seeking Breakthrough Makers**  \n\n  \n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) offers countless ways to change lives. Our diverse community of more than 20,000 Breakthrough Makers will inspire you to pursue passions, develop expertise, and drive innovation.  \n\n  \n\nAt CHOP, your experience is valued; your voice is heard; and your contributions make a difference for patients and families. Join us as we build on our promise to advance pediatric care\u2014and your career.  \n\n  \n\nCHOP does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or any other legally protected categories in any employment, training, or vendor decisions or programs. CHOP recognizes the critical importance of a workforce rich in varied backgrounds and experiences and engages in ongoing efforts to achieve that through equally varied and non\\-discriminatory means.  \n\n  \n\n**A Brief Overview**  \n\nUnder the direction/guidance of a mentor (principal investigator), assumes responsibility for a specific, on\\-going research project. The experience will serve to extend, refine and enhance skills necessary for professional and career development, and will enable the individual to broaden his/her scientific background by acquiring new research capabilities. It is expected that this individual will conduct independent scholarly research, and will contribute directly to the overall research goals of the project and the research group.  \n\n  \n\nThis role will be expected to participate in project planning, recording and interpretation/evaluation of data, and communication of results. This position will also be expected to acquire technical, lab management, and manuscript/grant writing skills; and participate in seminars, lectures, poster sessions and presentations at national meetings. This role also may be required to supervise junior lab members, develop new methods and protocols for research, and assist with the development of other research projects in the lab.\n\n**About the Laboratory**\n\nA postdoctoral position is available within the research teams of Prof. Struan Grant and Dr. Shaon Sengupta at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, an interdisciplinary institution dedicated to conducting basic, clinical and translational research on conditions and diseases that affect children. Visit http://www.research.chop.edu for more information about The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and its related programs. Opportunities for long term professional growth and promotion would be available.\n\n**POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOW**\n\n\nA postdoctoral fellow is needed to join a strong team involved in spanning both dry and wet lab approaches. The postdoctoral fellow will be affiliated with both the Sengupta and Grant labs, performing research, regulatory and managerial responsibilities for both groups. The two labs are next door to each other, share some common space and have a history of collaboration and resource\\-pooling. The Grant lab\u2019s overarching aim is to elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits, principally in pediatrics \u2013 focusing principally on sleep and obesity\\-related traits. These studies will build on the already seminal work that has emerged from genome wide studies conducted at CHOP and at other peer institutions. The Sengupta lab studies the effect of circadian rhythms in protecting against lung injury from viral infections, using animal models, cell culture and organoid systems. The circadian focus on lung biology and immunology provides several unique and exciting research opportunities for scientific inquiry. Overall, the distinct areas of investigation for the Grant and the Sengupta labs allows the ideal candidate to acquire and develop different but important skillsets, providing unique professional and scientific opportunities. Furthermore, there will be opportunities to build joint projects across the two labs focused on sleep.\n\n\nThe successful candidate will possess excellent research, communication, organizational and leadership skills, including detailed recordkeeping, computer literacy, scientific writing and the ability to contribute to method development and validation as well as work seamlessly with two teams. After initial training, this individual is expected to perform independently with minimal guidance and will work closely with the Principal Investigators, Prof. Struan Grant and Dr. Shaon Sengupta, to facilitate the daily operation of the lab as part of the position, thereby helping to develop lab management skills. We are looking for a candidate with experience in various molecular biology techniques, animal models, flowcytometry, utilization of bioinformatics tools, application of statistical methods and supervision of research scientists. Experience or knowledge of lung biology and circadian biology will be viewed favorably but not essential. Abundant opportunities to mentor trainees (undergraduate and graduate students) are available. Further, several opportunities for professional development through the CHOP research institute are available for customization based on future career goals. Option to pursue work under a T32 program may also be available for those eligible.\n\n**JOB\\-SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n\n\nHave research projects in each of the labs, which they are driving to ensure continued scientific development.
