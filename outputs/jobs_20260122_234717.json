With a legacy of innovation since 1899, a presence in more than 30 countries, and more than 19,000 employees, we are advancing breakthrough therapies in oncology, cardiovascular disease, rare diseases, and immune disorders. Guided by our 2030 vision to \"be an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society\", we are shaping a healthier, more hopeful future for patients, their families, and society.\n  \n  \n\nJob Summary\n  \n  \n\nIntegrated Knowledgebase for Genomics Insights into Topoisomerase I inhibitor\\-Based Antibody\u2013Drug Conjugates (ADCs)\n  \n  \n\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) using topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (DXd series) have demonstrated significant clinical success across multiple tumor types. However, diverse and multifaceted mechanisms of resistance contribute to heterogenous patient responses. These resistance mechanisms include (i) antigen loss (ii) reduced internalization (iii) increased clearance of payload (iv) alterations in payload target and (v) upregulation of anti\\-apoptotic proteins. Understanding of resistance mechanisms that affect each step of ADC MoA is crucial to stratify patient populations with a better clinical outcome and identify rational combination strategies to overcome resistance.\n  \n  \n\nWe propose to develop an Integrated ADC Genomics Knowledgebase that systematically aggregates, curates, and harmonizes experimental findings from multi\\-omics studies and CRISPR screens spanning distinct ADC MoA steps. This centralized resource will accelerate hypothesis generation, biomarker discovery, and cross\\-program learning within the ADC portfolio.\n  \n  \n\nScientific Scope\n  \n  \n\nThe knowledgebase will focus on topoisomerase I inhibitor payload ADCs and organize findings according to key mechanistic stages of ADC action\n  \n  \n\nData Sources and Integration\n  \n  \n\nThe resource will integrate data from both public and internal sources using standardized identifiers and metadata fields. Data Sources\n  \n  \n\n* Public databases: DepMap, CCLE, GEO, ArrayExpress, PubMed\n* Internal datasets: preclinical ADC and biomarker studies\n* Literature\\-derived results via NLP\\-based text mining\n\n\nIntegration workflow\n  \n  \n\n* Data Search: Create comprehensive list of relevant studies and datasets\n* Data Processing and Curation: Develop processing pipelines for omics data and standardize metadata.\n* Knowledge Integration: Create relational schema linking genes, pathways, functional assays, resources etc.\n* Meta analysis: Identify consistent signatures associated with sensitivity or resistance\n* Data Visualization: Build interactive dashboards (Shiny/Streamlit) for visualization and analytics.\n\n\nExpected Outcomes\n  \n  \n\nCentralized resource for ADC mechanism, cross\\-program learning, biomarker hypothesis identification or validation. Responsibilities\n  \n  \n\n* Aggregate and analyze large\\-scale RNA\\-seq, CRISPR, and proteomics datasets relevant to ADC MoAs.\n* Conduct meta\\-analysis to identify consistent mechanisms across different studies and datatypes.\n* Collaborate with translational scientists to interpret biological insights and MoA connections.\n* Contribute to the creation of curated gene and pathway summaries for knowledgebase ingestion. Qualifications\n* Enrolled in Ph.D. in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Systems Biology, or related field (2nd year onwards preferred).\n* Strong experience with R/Bioconductor.\n* Familiarity with public datasets (DepMap, CCLE, GEO, TCGA, MSigDB, Reactome).\n* Knowledge of multi\\-omics integration, enrichment analysis, and data harmonization.\n* Experience with oncology or ADC\\-related biology preferred.\n\n\nDaiichi Sankyo, Inc. is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
