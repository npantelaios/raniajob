Our public benefit purpose is to provide a brighter future for patients through the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies; and technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs.  \n\nUnited Therapeutics (Nasdaq: UTHR) seeks to travel down the corridors of indifference to develop treatments for rare, deadly diseases. We were founded in 1996 by a family seeking a cure for their daughter\u2019s pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Today, we have six FDA\\-approved therapies that treat PAH, pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH\\-ILD) and neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. Our near\\-term pipeline seeks to develop additional therapies for PAH and pulmonary fibrosis (PF).  \n\nThe cure for end\\-stage life\\-threatening diseases like PAH, PH\\-ILD, PF, and many others is an organ transplant, but only a small percentage of donated organs are available to address the vast need. For this reason, we are working to create manufactured organs to address the shortage of kidneys, hearts, lungs, and livers available for transplant. We believe an unlimited supply of tolerable, transplantable organs will eliminate the transplant waiting list and cure end\\-stage organ diseases for which transplant is not currently an option.  \n\nMillions worldwide are living with chronic kidney disease or diabetes. Management and maintenance therapies are ongoing, expensive, and often undermine the person\u2019s quality of life. Their only hope for a cure is an kidney transplant. Unfortunately, the shortage of available kidneys causes patients to spend an average of 5 or more years on the waitlist, and many die before receiving surgery. At IVIVA, we are working to transform the status quo by developing fully implantable bioartificial kidneys. Our goal is to develop a cure that can allows patients with kidney dysfunction to lead a normal life  \n\nHow you\u2019ll contribute\nThere has never been a more exciting time to join IVIVA, a United Therapeutics company.

However, diverse and multifaceted mechanisms of resistance contribute to heterogenous patient responses. These resistance mechanisms include (i) antigen loss (ii) reduced internalization (iii) increased clearance of payload (iv) alterations in payload target and (v) upregulation of anti\\-apoptotic proteins. Understanding of resistance mechanisms that affect each step of ADC MoA is crucial to stratify patient populations with a better clinical outcome and identify rational combination strategies to overcome resistance.\n  \n  \n\nWe propose to develop an Integrated ADC Genomics Knowledgebase that systematically aggregates, curates, and harmonizes experimental findings from multi\\-omics studies and CRISPR screens spanning distinct ADC MoA steps. This centralized resource will accelerate hypothesis generation, biomarker discovery, and cross\\-program learning within the ADC portfolio.\n  \n  \n\nScientific Scope\n  \n  \n\nThe knowledgebase will focus on topoisomerase I inhibitor payload ADCs and organize findings according to key mechanistic stages of ADC action\n  \n  \n\nData Sources and Integration\n  \n  \n\nThe resource will integrate data from both public and internal sources using standardized identifiers and metadata fields.

Responsibilities\n  \n  \n\n* Aggregate and analyze large\\-scale RNA\\-seq, CRISPR, and proteomics datasets relevant to ADC MoAs.\n* Conduct meta\\-analysis to identify consistent mechanisms across different studies and datatypes.\n* Collaborate with translational scientists to interpret biological insights and MoA connections.\n* Contribute to the creation of curated gene and pathway summaries for knowledgebase ingestion.
